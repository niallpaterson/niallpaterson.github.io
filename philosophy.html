                    The anti-luck intuition in epistemology is based on the idea that in a range of interesting
                    cases in which agents fail to know, it is because their belief is true 'by luck', 'by accident',
                    'by coincidence' and so on. This is supposed to be a fruitful realisation since by explicating 
                    the relevant notion of luck, we are in a position to gain insight into the nature of knowing.
                    The dominant view is that the relevant notion of luck is modal in character, in particular that
                    lucky events are one's that could easily have failed to occur. Applied to the theory of knowledge,
                    one is lucky to be right just in case one could have easily falsely believed. This paper draws on
                    the contemporary `hyperintensional revolution' to provide an argument against this view. It is argued
                    that epistemic luck is hyperintensional, and hence cannot be adequetly captured by modal notions
                    such as safety from error. In conclusion, it is tentatively suggested that epistemic luck's 
                    hyperintensionality derives from its being an explanatory notion, and an analogy is drawn with failures of probabilstic 
                    conceptions of explanation in the philosophy of science.

                <p class="article-content"> 
                    This paper argues that the the anti-luck intuition in epistemology is better captured by the predicate 'accident'
                    than 'luck'. The argument is abductive: it is shown that on the theory of accidentality developed, a 'no-accidents'
                    epistemology has the theorical virtues of an 'anti-luck' epistemology, but that, importantly, it can do more. The basic thoguht 
                    behind the theory of accidents is that they are a class of what Frankfurt called 'purposive behaviours'; an accidental event is 
                    one such that an agent purposively &Phi;-s, but where either the purpose of the agent's behaviour was not to &Phi;, or else the 
                    agent deviantly &Phi;-d. It is argued that this notion of accidentality is causal-explanatory. The paper thus argues that epistemic luck
                    is better captured by causal-explanatory, rather than orthadox modal notions. In conclusion, an error theory is given
                    for the intuitive appeal, and explanatory power of modal notions such as safety from error.</p>
